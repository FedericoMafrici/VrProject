# Connecting Nature

## Description
Imagine a relaxing paradise in the middle of nowhere, where you can befriend and take care of animals from across the world.
Explore unique biomes in the creative arrangement of connected floating islands suspended in the sky, manage your little farm and satisfy the needs of the creatures of the land.
Complete the tasks and learn facts about your new friends, get your rewards, and embark for a new journey!

This project was developed for the Virtual Reality course at Politecnico di Torino, under the supervision of professors A. Bottino and F. Strada.
